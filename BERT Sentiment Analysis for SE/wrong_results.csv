8;No buddy, You can't simply upgrade ZF1 to ZF2. In case you need you move to ZF2 be sure that ZF2 is not just an upper version of ZF1 but the whole Architecture is also changed.So, If you really need to move then 1. Firstly you will need to remove ZF1 library completely.2. Install ZF2 package.3. Now make changes in your code to work accordingly with ZF2 as most of the things will stop working once to move to ZF2.However, I would suggest don't migrate to ZF2 just for the sake of upgrading, migrate only if you dont have any other choice.

136;You also might want to check out Uche Ogbuji's excellent XML Data Binding Library, Amara: (Documentation here: ) The cool thing about Amara is that it turns an XML document in to a Python object, so you can just do stuff like: (which creates a Record element that contains Name and Value elements (which in turn contain the values of the name and value variables)).;neutral;positive
137;"I'm working on a package which includes rescaling of images in PHP. For image rescaling, PHP has the GD and ImageMagick libraries. Are those likely to be part of a given client's PHP install already? Is there a ""default"" install of PHP, for that matter? By default, are either GD or ImageMagick included? If neither is installed, should I have some sort of horrible fallback position of reading, rescaling, and saving GIFs, JPGs, and PNGs, or is it simple to add GD or ImageMagick to an existing install?";neutral;negative
138;My experience - If you know the requirements of a project well and if they can be easily achieved with standard ssis components with a minimum of scripting, then SSIS might be the way to go. Otherwise, its a pain.;neutral;negative

140;"is excellent for scripts; is standard for classes. As Ben says, think of it as ""Object"" -- but it is much cooler in that it does not constrain you to the Object methods. This has neat implications with respect to imports. e.g. In this snippet I have to import FileChannel e.g. But here I can just 'wing it' as long as everything is on the classpath";neutral;positive
141;How awesome would it be if the Delphi IDE would put code in 2 formats on the clipboard, so that code that is copied and pasted in e-mails or word-documents has proper highlighting instead of plain text?!;negative;positive
142;"Basically, the doctype determines how crazy IE is going to be. If you don't set it to XHTML, or ""strict"" you'll be living in a world of hurt when it comes to IE (even if you set it, you'll still be hating on IE, but it does make it a lot better).";negative;neutral
143;@Pax, from my personal experience, somehow I always get faster and more reliable results when I'm using tables. But every time I did that, I feel guilty.;neutral;negative

145;Curious that none of them considered Stopwatch yet? Precise and bigger than , not involving OS horrific perf counters, WMI or native calls, and well really simple:;neutral;positive
146;This reply is incomplete: we currently have an app that is leaking permgen memory and the number of loaded classes is absolutely constant. Both facts can be seen by using JConsole. We suffer from the same problem as the original poster in that we have no way to analyze the permgen in detail.;negative;neutral
147;The other issue the number of variations in everyone's SIP implementation. Solving all of the integration issues would quickly eat up all your time. At $699 for OCS that just doesn't make much sense.;negative;neutral

149;i've got the following code which runs a bat file. the bat file then runs some .exe .. which does some stuff. The stuff takes aroun 5-10 seconds. What i'm trying to do is leave the command window open, even after the process terminates. Is there any way to do this? Otherwise, can i get all the output of that window going to my debugger instead, so i don't need to worry about this window remaining? cheers.;neutral;positive
150;@yaauie - sure, I could have put a `raise 'oh no' if methods.include?(:after_initialize)` before the monkeypatch, but that would make the example harder to understand... It's so easy to get caught up in detailing all the edge cases that the actual lesson here (just patch a base method in) would get lost in the noise.;neutral;negative
